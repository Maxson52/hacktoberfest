# Spooked!

## Read and write scary stories ðŸ‘»

A fun and scary Octoberfest project using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) on the front-end and [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) on the back-end.

Check it out [here](https://spooked.vercel.app/)

## How To Be Spooked!

The objective is simple. Write your own creative ending based on the prompt.

- First, you find a prompt that you find interesting, some prompts are short, some are long. You can even create your own prompt!
- Continue reading the prompt by clicking it. You'll see the prompt and the stories others have come up with below.
- Once you've finished reading, you can submit your ending of the story by typing in the reply box at the bottom of the page.

## Tech Stack

This project was done entirely with SvelteKit and Supabase, using Moment.js for a few things. Check out [the database readme](database/README.md) for a behind the scenes look on the use of Supabase in this project.

## Dev Team

Spooked! was made entirely by [me](https://github.com/Maxson52) over the past week. A bit of help getting started with SvelteKit and postgres triggers also made this possible.

## Behind The Idea

As I saw this hackathon announced, I knew it was about time for me to enter. I brainstormed a few ideas, some good and most bad. At one point, I planned on making a costume idea generator, where users could share Halloween costume ideas, however this idea was quickly shot down by the potential non-costume submissions. Finally, I settled on this, where users can come together to write scary stories in the spirit of Halloween.
