  <h1>Guidelines</h1>

  <p>
    Be sure to follow these guidelines to prevent your replies from being
    blocked
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Stay on topic, your reply should be an extension of the previous reply,
      not a whole new story
    </li>
    <li>
      Limit corse language/violence/goriness. If you would read your reply to
      your grandma, it's likely fine
    </li>
    <li>
      Check for spelling and grammar errors. If you make a mistake, there's no
      going back
    </li>
    <li>
      Don't write too much! Keep in mind that you want to leave room for other
      people to continue the story after you
    </li>
    <li>
      Don't end the story! Just when you planned on closing up shop, someone
      else might have a killer twist, so no conclusions... ever!
    </li>
  </ul>
