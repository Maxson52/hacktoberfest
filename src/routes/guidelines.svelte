  <p>
    Be sure to follow these guidelines to prevent your stories from being

  <ul>
    <li>
      Stay on topic, your reply should be an extension of the prompt, not a
      whole new story. For that, you can submit your own prompt on the home
      page.
    </li>
    <li>
      Limit corse language/violence/goriness. If you would read your story to
      your grandma, it's probably fine.
    </li>
    <li>
      Check for spelling and grammar errors. If you make a mistake, there's no
      going back.
